#This simple script will enable swap at boot using a swap file.
#Make sure you change the value of SWAP_PATH below to point to the file or partition you need to use.
#This script is intended to run from init.d directory at boot.
#It must be executed with root privilledges.
#If this script does not work, even if you have init.d support on your ROM, please try using an App that emulates init.d
